Hello world;

This is a personal project i'm currently using to develop my coding skills;
Feel free to review the code and suggest new features;
I'll use the suggestions to improve my coding;

// concept;

The Life Rpg is an app/game that allow you to insert your own quests;
Theses quests are real life things like "clean the house" or "go to the supermarket";
You complete the quests to win XP to level up and improve your character;
Then you fight enemys in a turn based RPG;
Someday this will be a great tool to help me stop procrastinating;

// changelog;

v0.01 it's the basic of the game. Showing the initial sketchs of the HUD;

// road map;

In v0.02 I want to add an "esc" menu where people could use the "help" button to understand what every stats means;

// notes;

This is not a product idea or a future app;
Feel free to use the code any way you want;

{peace amoung ourselves, war to the tyrants}
